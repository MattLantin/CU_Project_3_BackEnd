# Surgery Cost Across US States

A simple web-app to visualize surgery cost accros US states

## Description

The cost of surgery can vary significantly across the United States, with a range of several thousand dollars for common procedures. This variation is due to a number of factors, including the type of surgery, the surgeon's experience, the geographic location, and the type of insurance plan.

For example, according to a study by the FAIR Health Care organization, the average cost of a hip replacement in the United States is $30,000. However, the cost can range from $15,000 to $55,000, depending on the state. For example, the average cost of a hip replacement in New York is $45,000, while the average cost in Mississippi is $20,000.

The variation in surgery costs across the United States can be a significant burden for patients. As such, it is important for patients to shop around for the best price on surgery and to understand their insurance coverage before undergoing surgery. This web-app aims to provide users with a simple tool to making finding the most cost effective health care facility to under a particular surgery.
